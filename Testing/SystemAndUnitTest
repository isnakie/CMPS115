SPRINT 1:
- As a beginning investor, I'd like a Website that is online, so I know where to go for good information on Stocks.
- As a beginning investor, I’d like to see what my potential capital gain is given a principal value (how much I make with some amount), in order to conveniently see how much money I could make.
- As an investor, I want to have a visual overview of the stock prices over a given timeframe, because I would like to predict future returns with past behaviors.

SPRINT 2:
As a beginning investor, I’d like to see improved stock graphs implemented into Blash.
As an investor, I'd like to see an implemented portfolio: have basic table and can submit/edit a single line.

SPRINT 3:
As a beginning user of the app, I want to learn to use this app and the basics of investing so I can make smart choices when picking stocks. 
As an on-the-go investor, I want to get quick textual reports about the (stock) market to provide information for my investing decisions.
