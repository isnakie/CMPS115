testing


Tutorial Module:
No testing needed other than loading the page, which is correctly done.

Portfolio Module: (Sean)
Testing included entering various stock symbols, valid and invalid and seeing the results.
  The valid results were correct with all stocks that are part of the system.
  Invalid results were:
    Only entering Symbol with no Quantity or purchase price
      This results in an "Enter a value" message. This is resolved correctly
    Entering an incorrect symbol into Stock or WatchList
      This results in an error in the page
    Entering an incorrect Symbol into search function
      This results in default graph <AAPL>
      
Stock Module: (Kenny)
Testing included looking up various different stocks
  Entering an incorrect Symbol into search function
      This results in default graph <AAPL> with incorrect title
      
News Module: (Johnnie)
Testing included looking up various different stocks
  Entering an incorrect Symbol into search function
      This results in an error message "invalid stock"
      
Calculator Module: (Kenny)
Testing included entering various values into the search functions.
  This includes wrong inputs such as characters that are not ints, and commas
    This results in error in the website.
  The calculator includes a graph that is not refreshed until the actual page is refreshed. 
    This is located in the python code and can be fixed if it manually refreshes the page. This only happens sometimes.
  Another error is when the calculated number becomes too large, the code does not handle when the value is too large
    This results in an error in the website.
