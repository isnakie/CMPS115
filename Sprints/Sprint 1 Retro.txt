Sprint Review:
- Website is online.
- As a beginning investor, Iâ€™d like to see what my potential capital gain is given a principal value (how much I make with some amount), in order to conveniently see how much money I could make.
- As an investor, I want to have a visual overview of the stock prices over a given timeframe, because I would like to predict future returns with past behaviors.

- Visual Graphs: Finished
- Calculator: Finished
- Portfolio: NOT FINISHED
